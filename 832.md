## Development Feature 832:


**@Jin's Issue**

* as an Admin I would like to add reports even though they might not exisit on a profile.

**add the functionality to add profile reports if there are none**
something `isAdmin && this.reports.length == 0 : <add component>`

**@Angie's Issues**

- When I log in as Con Mgr I can see the reports tab but no reports are setup.

- When I click on the tab I setup a box with Access Denied to Display Query Runner Reports.

- Tab should not display for Con Mgr until reports are added.

**Does the above mean that the user should be able to see the reports when they do exisit or should the tab simply be hidden for the con manager**

- When I log in as POURS or Admin is see the tab which is correct but when I go into the tab I have no option to add reports.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  

examine Pours show/hide functionality. as in `SMI`, `BIPP` types

**If we are unable to hide it**

* visibile only to admin, Pours, are the edit and ad functionality, everyone else can just see it.
